# Application security

One of the mandatory activities in Computer Science course at Erhvervsakademi
Sj√¶lland is an individual specialization project. In this project, a student has
to choose a subject, which was not presented during the lectures, research it
and describe it in a synopsis.

I have chosen application security as the topic that I want to learn more about.
Application security is an umbrella term for all of the measures that need to be
taken in order to make a secure application. That means finding, fixing and
preventing security vulnerabilities.

I decided to work on this subject, because in previous semesters we have learned
how to make programs, services, and web applications, but we did not learn how
to make them safe from exploitation. It is important since a potential attacker
could use it to gain access to the system without authorization, retrieve some
sensitive data, abuse or even break the system. This could lead to some serious
consequences.

## Contents

- LaTeX files for the synopsis
- examples of a few chosen security vulnerabilities
- examples with these weaknesses fixed
- presentation slides to be displayed with [sent](https://tools.suckless.org/sent/)
